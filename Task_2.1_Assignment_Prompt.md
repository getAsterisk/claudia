# APM Task Assignment: OpenRouter Setup

## 1. Agent Role & APM Context

You are activated as an Implementation Agent (Agent_Integration) within the Agentic Project Management (APM) framework for the Claudia project enhancement. Your role is to execute assigned tasks and log your work meticulously in the Memory Bank.

## 2. Context from Prior Work

This task begins Phase 2 (OpenAI-Compatible Integration) following the completion of Phase 1's agent engine infrastructure. The foundation for multi-engine support is in place with:
- Agent struct enhanced with engine field
- Database schema updated
- Execution logic refactored for multiple engines

## 3. Task Assignment

**Reference:** This assignment corresponds to Task 2.1 - Agent_Integration: OpenRouter Setup in Phase 2 of the Implementation Plan.

**Objective:** Implement OpenRouter API integration for model flexibility.

**Detailed Action Steps:**

1. Environment Variable Handling
   - Navigate to `src-tauri/src/commands/agents.rs`
   - Add OPENROUTER_API_KEY validation logic
   - Implement binary detection for aider-chat and opencodex
   - Add comprehensive error handling for missing dependencies
   - Critical: Use std::env::var for environment variable access
   
2. OpenRouter API Client Implementation
   - Create OpenRouter API integration using reqwest crate
   - Implement models endpoint integration (https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models)
   - Add proper response parsing and validation
   - Implement retry logic for API failures
   - Critical: Consider creating a dedicated module for API client functionality

## 4. Expected Output & Deliverables

Successful completion requires:
1. Environment variable handling:
   - OPENROUTER_API_KEY validation
   - Binary dependency detection
   - Error handling implementation
   
2. OpenRouter API client:
   - Working models endpoint integration
   - Response parsing and validation
   - Retry mechanism
   - Error handling
   
3. All changes must:
   - Compile without errors
   - Handle API errors gracefully
   - Return proper error messages to frontend

## 5. Memory Bank Logging Instructions

Upon completion of this task, you must log your work in the Memory Bank file located at:
`Memory/Phase_2_OpenAI_Compatible_Integration/Task_2.1_OpenRouter_Setup_Log.md`

Your log entry must strictly follow the format defined in `prompts/02_Utility_Prompts_And_Format_Definitions/Memory_Bank_Log_Format.md` and include:
- Clear reference to Task 2.1
- Details of environment variable handling implementation
- OpenRouter API client implementation details
- Any challenges encountered and their resolutions
- Confirmation of successful API integration testing

## 6. Dependencies and Prerequisites

Ensure that:
1. Phase 1 tasks are fully completed and verified
2. The agent execution system supports multiple engines
3. You have access to:
   - OpenRouter API documentation
   - Valid OPENROUTER_API_KEY for testing
   - Required crates (reqwest) are available

## 7. Technical Requirements

1. Error Handling:
   - Implement proper error types for API failures
   - Handle network timeouts and retries
   - Provide clear error messages for missing dependencies
   
2. API Integration:
   - Use proper HTTP headers for OpenRouter API
   - Implement response caching if appropriate
   - Follow rate limiting guidelines
   
3. Security:
   - Secure handling of API keys
   - Proper validation of API responses
   - Safe error message handling

## 8. Clarification Instructions

If any part of this task is unclear, particularly regarding:
- OpenRouter API requirements
- Error handling expectations
- Environment variable configuration

Please ask for clarification before proceeding with implementation.
