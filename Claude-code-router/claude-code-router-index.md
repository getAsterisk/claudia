# Tutorial: claude-code-router

The `claude-code-router` is a **smart proxy** that acts as a *central hub* for Claude Code AI requests. It intelligently **routes** these requests to different *AI models and providers* based on user-defined **configuration rules**, also *transforming* requests and responses to ensure compatibility across various APIs. It simplifies managing and optimizing AI interactions and can run as a **background service**.
