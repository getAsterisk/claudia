      "findings": "The provided code represents the backend systems for a desktop application built with Rust and the Tauri framework. The core responsibilities include managing Claude Code sessions, agent execution, sandboxing, checkpointing, and MCP (Multi-Agent Communication Protocol) server management.\n\nHere's a deep analysis of the assigned code files:\n\n## Deep Analysis Report\n\n### `src/lib/api.ts`\n\n*   **Purpose**: This TypeScript file serves as the public API client for the frontend. It defines the data interfaces (DTOs) that are exchanged between the frontend (React/TypeScript) and the Rust backend, and exports an `api` object containing asynchronous functions that `invoke` Tauri commands.\n*   **Key Functionality**:\n    *   **Interface Definitions**: Clearly defines data structures for `Project`, `Session`, `ClaudeSettings`, `ClaudeVersionStatus`, `ClaudeMdFile`, `FileEntry`, `SandboxProfile`, `SandboxRule`, `PlatformCapabilities`, `OperationSupport`, `SandboxViolation`, `SandboxViolationStats`, `SandboxProfileExport`, `SandboxProfileWithRules`, `ImportResult`, `Agent`, `AgentRun`, `AgentRunMetrics`, `AgentRunWithMetrics`, `UsageEntry`, `ModelUsage`, `DailyUsage`, `ProjectUsage`, `UsageStats`, `Checkpoint`, `CheckpointMetadata`, `FileSnapshot`, `TimelineNode`, `SessionTimeline`, `CheckpointStrategy`, `CheckpointResult`, `CheckpointDiff`, `FileDiff`, `MCPServer`, `ServerStatus`, `MCPProjectConfig`, `MCPServerConfig`, `AddServerResult`, `ImportServerResult`. This is a comprehensive set covering almost all backend functionalities.\n    *   **API Client (`api` object)**: Exposes a structured set of functions (e.g., `listProjects`, `executeAgent`, `createCheckpoint`, `mcpList`) that map directly to Tauri commands.\n    *   **Error Handling**: Each `invoke` call is wrapped in a `try-catch` block, logging errors to the console and re-throwing them as `string` or `Error` for frontend consumption.\n*   **Design Decisions/Patterns**:\n    *   **Frontend-Backend Contract**: Acts as the single source of truth for the IPC contract, ensuring type safety and consistency between frontend calls and backend command signatures.\n    *   **Facade Pattern**: The `api` object provides a simplified interface to complex backend functionalities.\n*   **Potential Issues/Improvements**:\n    *   **Error Detail**: The re-thrown errors often convert the `error` object to a string, losing structured error details that might be useful for more granular error handling on the frontend. Consider returning custom error objects or more structured strings.\n    *   **Redundant Type `ImportResult`**: There are two `ImportResult` interfaces, one for sandbox profiles and one for MCP servers, with slightly different structures. This could lead to confusion. It might be better to rename one or use a generic approach. (Self-correction: The second one is `ImportServerResult` which is a sub-type, but the top-level `ImportResult` is indeed duplicated, one for Sandbox and one for MCP, with different inner structures `profile_name` vs `imported_count`/`failed_count`. This is a minor issue but could be clearer).\n    *   **`any` Usage**: `todo_data?: any;` in `Session` and `getClaudeSettings`'s `result.data` handling (`typeof result === 'object' && 'data' in result`) indicate areas where stricter typing could be beneficial if the JSON structure is known.\n\n### `src-tauri/capabilities/default.json`\n\n*   **Purpose**: This JSON file defines a Tauri \"capability\" named \"default\". Capabilities are a security mechanism in Tauri that specify what permissions a window (or webview) has to access the underlying Rust commands.\n*   **Key Functionality**:\n    *   **`identifier`: \"default\"**: Name of this capability.\n    *   **`description`: \"Capability for the main window\"**: Explains its purpose.\n    *   **`windows`: [\"main\"]**: Applies this capability to the main application window.\n    *   **`permissions`**: Lists the allowed command sets.\n        *   `\"core:default\"`: Grants default permissions for core Tauri plugins (path, event, window, webview, app, image, resources, menu, tray).\n        *   `\"opener:default\"`: Allows opening URLs (mailto, tel, http/https) and revealing files in directories using default applications.\n        *   `\"dialog:default\"`: Allows all types of dialogs (ask, confirm, message, save, open).\n        *   `\"dialog:allow-open\"`: Explicitly allows the `dialog:open` command (redundant given `dialog:default` includes it, but harmless).\n        *   `\"shell:allow-execute\"`, `\"shell:allow-spawn\"`, `\"shell:allow-open\"`: Crucial for a Claude Code application, as it needs to execute external binaries (`claude`) and spawn child processes. These permissions grant broad shell access.\n*   **Design Decisions/Patterns**:\n    *   **Principle of Least Privilege**: In a sandboxed application, this file should ideally be as restrictive as possible. However, given the nature of a coding assistant that needs to run external tools, some broad permissions are necessary.\n*   **Potential Issues/Improvements**:\n    *   **Broad Shell Permissions**: `\"shell:allow-execute\"` and `\"shell:allow-spawn\"` grant significant power. While necessary for this application, it means the renderer process (frontend) can request execution of arbitrary commands. The application should rely on backend-validated commands for agent execution rather than allowing direct frontend access to these broad shell commands, and ensure that agent commands themselves are sufficiently sandboxed. The backend logic for `execute_agent` and `create_sandboxed_claude_command` is designed to enforce this.\n    *   **Redundancy**: `\"dialog:allow-open\"` is redundant if `\"dialog:default\"` is already included.\n\n### `src-tauri/gen/schemas/acl-manifests.json`, `src-tauri/gen/schemas/capabilities.json`, `src-tauri/gen/schemas/desktop-schema.json`, `src-tauri/gen/schemas/linux-schema.json`\n\n*   **Purpose**: These JSON files are auto-generated by Tauri and define the schema for Access Control Lists (ACLs) and capabilities. They provide validation rules and documentation (descriptions) for the permissions configured in `default.json` and other capability files.\n    *   `acl-manifests.json`: Defines all available permissions and permission sets across core Tauri plugins, including their descriptions and commands.\n    *   `capabilities.json`: A processed/flattened version of the capabilities defined in `default.json` and potentially others. It's essentially the runtime interpretation of `default.json`.\n    *   `desktop-schema.json`, `linux-schema.json`: JSON schemas that validate the structure and content of capability files (`.json` files in `src-tauri/capabilities/`). They ensure that capability definitions adhere to the Tauri specification, including rules for `opener` and `shell` scopes.\n*   **Key Functionality**:\n    *   **Schema Enforcement**: Used by Tauri's build system to validate capability configurations.\n    *   **Documentation**: The `description` and `markdownDescription` fields within the schema provide inline documentation for developers configuring permissions.\n    *   **Permission Granularity**: Illustrates the fine-grained control Tauri offers over IPC commands, allowing specific commands (`allow-command`) or broader categories (`default` sets) and even custom scopes (e.g., specific URLs for `opener`, specific commands/arguments for `shell`).\n*   **Design Decisions/Patterns**:\n    *   **Declarative Security**: Tauri uses JSON files to declaratively define security policies, making them auditable and manageable.\n    *   **Platform-Specific Rules**: Schemas differentiate between platforms (`desktop-schema` vs `linux-schema`), hinting at potential platform-specific security considerations.\n*   **Potential Issues/Improvements**:\n    *   **Read-Only**: These are generated files and should not be manually edited. Their primary purpose is validation and reference.\n\n### `src-tauri/src/checkpoint/mod.rs`\n\n*   **Purpose**: This module serves as the central definition point for all data structures related to the checkpointing system. It uses `serde` for serialization/deserialization, enabling persistence and IPC.\n*   **Key Data Structures**:\n    *   `Checkpoint`: Core unit of the timeline, containing ID, session/project info, message index, timestamp, description, parent ID, and metadata.\n    *   `CheckpointMetadata`: Details about a checkpoint, including token usage, model, user prompt, file changes, and snapshot size.\n    *   `FileSnapshot`: Represents the state of a single file at a checkpoint, including content (compressed), hash, deletion status, permissions, and size.\n    *   `TimelineNode`: Node in the session's checkpoint tree, linking `Checkpoint`s and their children (for forks).\n    *   `SessionTimeline`: The overall timeline structure for a session, holding the root node, current checkpoint, and auto-checkpoint settings.\n    *   `CheckpointStrategy`: Enum for defining auto-checkpointing behavior (`Manual`, `PerPrompt`, `PerToolUse`, `Smart`).\n    *   `FileTracker`, `FileState`: Internal structs used by the `CheckpointManager` to track modified files.\n    *   `CheckpointResult`: Result of a checkpoint operation, including the checkpoint itself, files processed, and warnings.\n    *   `CheckpointDiff`, `FileDiff`: Structures for representing differences between two checkpoints.\n    *   `CheckpointPaths`: Utility struct for generating file system paths related to checkpoint storage.\n*   **Design Decisions/Patterns**:\n    *   **Clear Separation of Concerns**: `mod.rs` focuses solely on data definitions, leaving logic to `manager.rs`, `storage.rs`, and `state.rs`.\n    *   **Content-Addressable Storage**: `FileSnapshot` includes a `hash` and `storage.rs` mentions a `content_pool`, indicating that file content is stored by its hash, preventing duplication and enabling efficient deduplication of identical files across checkpoints.\n    *   **Timeline as Tree**: `TimelineNode` with `children` allows for branching/forking of sessions, which is a powerful feature for iterative development.\n*   **Potential Issues/Improvements**:\n    *   **`content` in `FileSnapshot`**: Storing `content: String` directly in `FileSnapshot` (even if compressed on disk) means it will be deserialized into memory as a `String`. For very large files, this could lead to high memory usage. If file diffing is the primary use case for content comparison, consider processing compressed bytes directly or on-demand loading.\n    *   **Error Handling**: `anyhow::Result` is used, which provides good context for errors.\n    *   **`u32` for `permissions`**: `permissions: Option<u32>` is Unix-specific. For cross-platform consistency, consider if Windows file attributes should also be captured or if this field is acceptable as Unix-only.\n\n### `src-tauri/src/checkpoint/manager.rs`\n\n*   **Purpose**: Implements the core business logic for managing checkpoints within a single session. It orchestrates file tracking, message parsing, snapshot creation, and interaction with the storage layer.\n*   **Key Functionality**:\n    *   **`new`**: Initializes the manager, including loading/creating the `SessionTimeline` and `CheckpointStorage`.\n    *   **`track_message`**: Appends new JSONL messages to an in-memory buffer. It also attempts to detect \"tool_use\" events to trigger `track_tool_operation`.\n    *   **`track_tool_operation`**: Heuristically identifies file modifications based on tool names (`edit`, `write`, `multiedit`, `bash`). For `bash` commands, it broadly marks all tracked files as potentially modified.\n    *   **`track_file_modification`**: Reads a file's content and metadata, calculates its hash, and updates the `FileTracker`. It intelligently determines if a file has *actually* been modified (hash change, existence change).\n    *   **`create_checkpoint`**: The central function for making a new checkpoint. It collects current messages, extracts metadata (user prompt, model, tokens), scans the project directory for all files (not just tracked ones initially), creates `FileSnapshot`s for *modified* files, saves data via `CheckpointStorage`, and updates the in-memory `SessionTimeline`.\n    *   **`restore_checkpoint`**: Reverts the project state to a specified checkpoint. It loads snapshots, deletes files that shouldn't exist, restores files that should, and updates the in-memory messages and file tracker. It also includes logic for cleaning up empty directories.\n    *   **`get_timeline`, `list_checkpoints`, `fork_from_checkpoint`**: Provides access to and manipulation of the session's checkpoint history.\n    *   **`should_auto_checkpoint`, `update_settings`**: Implements the auto-checkpointing logic based on configured strategies.\n    *   **`get_files_modified_since`, `get_last_modification_time`**: Allows querying file modification history.\n*   **Design Decisions/Patterns**:\n    *   **Stateful Manager**: `CheckpointManager` holds `Arc<RwLock<...>>` for `FileTracker`, `CheckpointStorage`, `SessionTimeline`, and `current_messages`, indicating concurrent-safe access to shared mutable state. This is appropriate for a long-lived session manager.\n    *   **Heuristic-based File Tracking**: For `bash` commands, it broadly marks files, which is a practical approach given the difficulty of parsing arbitrary shell commands.\n    *   **Atomic Operations (Logical)**: Checkpoint creation/restoration aims to be atomic for the session state on disk (though `fs::remove_file` and `fs::write` are not transactionally atomic in the OS).\n*   **Potential Issues/Improvements**:\n    *   **File I/O Performance**: `track_file_modification` (called by `create_checkpoint` for *all* files) and `restore_checkpoint` involve extensive file I/O (`fs::read_to_string`, `fs::metadata`, `fs::remove_file`, `fs::write`). For very large projects with many files, this could be slow. Consider optimizing by only reading necessary parts for hashing or using asynchronous I/O more extensively.\n    *   **`track_bash_side_effects`**: The heuristic is very broad (`command.contains(cmd)`). This could lead to unnecessary file scans or marking. A more sophisticated approach might involve static analysis of shell commands or integration with a file system watcher, but this adds complexity.\n    *   **`Arc<RwLock<Vec<String>>>` for `current_messages`**: Storing all JSONL messages in memory could consume significant RAM for long sessions. If only the *last* few messages or specific message types are needed frequently, consider an LRU cache or stream processing.\n    *   **No Rollback for Restore**: If `restore_checkpoint` fails midway (e.g., disk full), the project directory might be in an inconsistent state. A proper transactional approach or a \"staging area\" for restoration before committing changes would improve robustness.\n    *   **`collect_files` and `remove_empty_dirs`**: These are recursive and could also be slow for very deep or wide directories. Recursion depth limit is good.\n    *   **Unified Diff Generation**: `diff_content: None` in `FileDiff` indicates that actual diff content is not generated, which is a missing feature if detailed file changes are desired in the UI.\n\n### `src-tauri/src/checkpoint/state.rs`\n\n*   **Purpose**: Acts as a global, application-wide registry for `CheckpointManager` instances. It ensures that only one `CheckpointManager` exists per active session and provides thread-safe access to them.\n*   **Key Functionality**:\n    *   **`managers: Arc<RwLock<HashMap<String, Arc<CheckpointManager>>>>`**: Stores `CheckpointManager` instances mapped by session ID. `RwLock` allows multiple readers or a single writer, which is good for concurrent access from different Tauri commands. `Arc` allows sharing these managers across asynchronous tasks.\n    *   **`claude_dir: Arc<RwLock<Option<PathBuf>>>`**: Stores the base Claude directory path, ensuring it's set once and accessible to all managers.\n    *   **`get_or_create_manager`**: Central access point. If a manager exists for a `session_id`, it's returned; otherwise, a new one is created and registered.\n    *   **`get_manager`, `remove_manager`, `clear_all`, `active_count`, `list_active_sessions`, `has_active_manager`**: Standard registry operations.\n*   **Design Decisions/Patterns**:\n    *   **Singleton-like per Session**: Ensures resource efficiency and consistent state for each session.\n    *   **Concurrency (`RwLock`, `Arc`)**: Proper use of Rust's concurrency primitives for safe mutable shared state.\n*   **Potential Issues/Improvements**:\n    *   **Error Handling**: Propagates `anyhow::anyhow!` errors as `String` which loses context in the frontend. Consider custom error types.\n    *   **Memory Leak Potential**: If `remove_manager` is not consistently called when a session truly ends (e.g., application crash, unhandled session termination), old `CheckpointManager` instances might remain in the map, potentially holding onto resources. The `clear_checkpoint_manager` command is available for explicit cleanup.\n\n### `src-tauri/src/checkpoint/storage.rs`\n\n*   **Purpose**: Handles the persistent storage aspect of the checkpointing system. It manages reading from and writing to disk, including compression and content-addressable storage for file snapshots.\n*   **Key Functionality**:\n    *   **`new`**: Initializes with the base Claude directory.\n    *   **`init_storage`**: Creates the necessary directory structure for projects, sessions, checkpoints, and files.\n    *   **`save_checkpoint`**: Writes checkpoint metadata, compressed messages, and file snapshots to disk. It uses `update_timeline_with_checkpoint` to keep the timeline file consistent.\n    *   **`save_file_snapshot`**: Implements content-addressable storage for files. It hashes file content, stores unique content in a `content_pool`, and creates smaller reference files per checkpoint. This is a significant optimization for storage efficiency.\n    *   **`load_checkpoint`**: Reads a checkpoint's metadata, decompresses messages, and loads file snapshots by retrieving content from the `content_pool` based on references.\n    *   **`load_file_snapshots`**: Reconstructs `FileSnapshot` objects for a given checkpoint by reading reference files and their corresponding content from the pool.\n    *   **`save_timeline`, `load_timeline`**: Persists and loads the session timeline tree structure.\n    *   **`update_timeline_with_checkpoint`, `add_child_to_node`**: Logic for inserting new checkpoints into the timeline tree structure.\n    *   **`calculate_file_hash`, `generate_checkpoint_id`**: Utility functions for data integrity and unique IDs.\n    *   **`estimate_checkpoint_size`**: Provides a rough estimate of storage size.\n    *   **`cleanup_old_checkpoints`, `remove_checkpoint`, `garbage_collect_content`**: Implements a retention policy, removing old checkpoints and unreferenced file content from the storage pool.\n*   **Design Decisions/Patterns**:\n    *   **Content-Addressable Storage**: A very good design choice for version control systems and checkpointing, as it avoids storing redundant copies of unchanged files.\n    *   **Compression (`zstd`)**: Uses a fast and efficient compression algorithm for messages and file content, reducing disk space and potentially I/O.\n    *   **Hierarchical Storage**: Organizes data logically by project, session, and checkpoint.\n    *   **Timeline Tree**: Supports branching/forking of sessions, which is more powerful than a linear history.\n*   **Potential Issues/Improvements**:\n    *   **`unwrap_or_default`**: Using `unwrap_or_default` for file content when `fs::read_to_string` fails can hide issues. Better error propagation or specific handling might be needed.\n    *   **Error Handling in `add_child_to_node`**: Uses `anyhow::bail!` to indicate an error if the parent is not found, which is good.\n    *   **Metadata vs. Content Storage**: Metadata (checkpoint info, file references) and actual file content are stored separately. This is a robust approach.\n    *   **Lack of Concurrency Control for `cleanup_old_checkpoints`**: While `CheckpointManager` has `RwLock` for its components, `cleanup_old_checkpoints` in `CheckpointStorage` is called directly and might not have explicit locks over the *file system* operations, which could theoretically lead to race conditions if multiple threads tried to clean up or modify the same files concurrently. In practice, given `CheckpointManager`'s design, this might be less of an issue, but worth noting.\n\n### `src-tauri/src/commands/mod.rs`\n\n*   **Purpose**: This is a simple module declaration file, serving as an entry point to group all backend command modules.\n*   **Key Functionality**: Declares `claude`, `agents`, `sandbox`, `usage`, and `mcp` as public modules.\n*   **Design Decisions/Patterns**: Standard Rust module organization.\n\n### `src-tauri/src/commands/agents.rs`\n\n*   **Purpose**: Manages the lifecycle of AI agents (CRUD operations) and their execution. It handles spawning Claude Code processes, capturing their output, and persisting run history. It also integrates with the sandboxing and database components.\n*   **Key Functionality**:\n    *   **`Agent`, `AgentRun`, `AgentRunMetrics`, `AgentRunWithMetrics`**: Data structures for agents and their execution records, including computed metrics.\n    *   **`AgentDb`**: Tauri state wrapper for the SQLite database connection, used by `main.rs` to manage global DB access.\n    *   **`init_database`**: Initializes SQLite database schema for agents, runs, sandbox profiles/rules/violations, and app settings. Includes schema migrations (`ALTER TABLE`) for robustness.\n    *   **CRUD for Agents**: `list_agents`, `create_agent`, `update_agent`, `delete_agent`, `get_agent`.\n    *   **Agent Execution (`execute_agent`)**:\n        *   Retrieves agent details from DB.\n        *   Creates a new `AgentRun` record in DB with \"pending\" status.\n        *   **Dynamic Sandbox Profile Generation**: Based on agent permissions (`sandbox_enabled`, `enable_file_read`, etc.), it dynamically creates a `gaol::profile::Profile`. This is a very good security practice, tailoring permissions to each agent's needs.\n        *   **Claude Binary Discovery (`find_claude_binary`)**: Attempts to locate the `claude` executable by checking common paths, environment variables (`which`), and a stored path in the app settings database. This handles macOS GUI apps' limited `PATH` environment.\n        *   **Pre-execution Test**: Includes a debug-only test of the Claude binary (`claude --version`) and a test run of the actual command args without the sandbox env vars. This is good for diagnosing \"process failed to spawn\" issues.\n        *   **Process Spawning**: Uses `tokio::process::Command` to spawn the Claude process, piping `stdout` and `stderr`.\n        *   **Environment Variables**: `create_command_with_env` ensures essential environment variables (like `PATH`) are correctly propagated, even in GUI environments.\n        *   **Process Registration**: Registers the spawned process with `ProcessRegistry` to track its PID and live output.\n        *   **Output Streaming**: Asynchronously reads `stdout` and `stderr` line by line, emitting `agent-output` and `agent-error` events to the frontend.\n        *   **Session ID Extraction**: Parses JSONL output to find the `sessionId` and updates the `agent_runs` table.\n        *   **Timeout/Kill Logic**: Includes a 30-second timeout to detect stuck processes (e.g., waiting for input), attempting to `kill` them and marking the run as 'failed'. This is crucial for UX.\n    *   **Agent Run Management**: `list_agent_runs`, `get_agent_run`, `list_running_sessions`, `kill_agent_session`, `get_session_status`, `cleanup_finished_processes`.\n    *   **Metrics**: `AgentRunMetrics::from_jsonl` parses JSONL output to calculate token usage, cost, and duration. `get_agent_run_with_metrics` and `list_agent_runs_with_metrics` combine run data with these calculated metrics.\n    *   **Live Output**: `get_live_session_output` retrieves live buffered output from the `ProcessRegistry`. `get_session_output` tries JSONL file first, then falls back to live buffer. `stream_session_output` monitors the JSONL file for changes and emits updates.\n    *   **Claude Binary Path Management**: `get_claude_binary_path` and `set_claude_binary_path` allow users to configure the Claude executable path. Includes path validation.\n*   **Design Decisions/Patterns**:\n    *   **State Management (Tauri `State`)**: Uses `AgentDb` and `ProcessRegistryState` to manage shared database and process registry instances across commands.\n    *   **Asynchronous Processing**: Extensive use of `tokio::spawn` for non-blocking I/O (reading process output, monitoring files) and `async/await` for database operations.\n    *   **Process Registry**: Centralizes tracking of child processes, essential for managing long-running agent executions.\n    *   **Database Schema Evolution**: `ALTER TABLE` statements in `init_database` demonstrate a practical approach to schema updates for existing installations.\n*   **Potential Issues/Improvements**:\n    *   **Hardcoded Sandbox Rules**: While flexible via agent settings, some common system paths are hardcoded within `execute_agent` to enable basic functionality (e.g., `/usr/bin`). This is a pragmatic choice, but a more configurable approach might involve a \"base system rules\" profile.\n    *   **`Dangerously-skip-permissions`**: The `--dangerously-skip-permissions` argument is passed to Claude Code. This is necessary for Claude to operate within a sandbox, as it tells Claude *not* to enforce its *own* internal sandboxing, relying instead on the `gaol` sandbox. This should be explicitly documented.\n    *   **`find_claude_binary`**: The production build disables `which` command. This means in production, it strictly relies on hardcoded paths or a user-set path. This is a common Tauri limitation but might make initial setup harder for some users. The manual path setting helps mitigate this.\n    *   **Error Handling**: Consistent `map_err(|e| e.to_string())` can obscure detailed error information. Custom error types and more structured `Err` returns would improve debugging and frontend error display.\n    *   **`stream_session_output` Polling**: This command polls the JSONL file periodically (`tokio::time::Duration::from_millis(500)`). While simple, a file system watcher (like `notify` crate) would be more efficient and real-time on some platforms.\n\n### `src-tauri/src/commands/claude.rs`\n\n*   **Purpose**: Provides commands for general interaction with Claude Code beyond specific agent execution, including file system operations, managing `CLAUDE.md`, reading settings, and directly interacting with Claude Code CLI (e.g., `claude -p`, `claude -c`). It also bridges the gap to the checkpointing system.\n*   **Key Functionality**:\n    *   **Claude Code Installation (`find_claude_binary`, `check_claude_version`)**: Identical to the agent commands, ensuring consistent Claude binary discovery.\n    *   **Project/Session Listing (`list_projects`, `get_project_sessions`)**: Scans `~/.claude/projects` to discover and parse project and session metadata, including extracting the actual project path from JSONL files and gathering `todo_data`.\n    *   **Settings Management (`get_claude_settings`, `save_claude_settings`)**: Reads and writes the `~/.claude/settings.json` file.\n    *   **CLAUDE.md Management (`get_system_prompt`, `save_system_prompt`, `find_claude_md_files`, `read_claude_md_file`, `save_claude_md_file`)**: Enables managing the global and project-specific `CLAUDE.md` files, which often contain system prompts. Includes recursive file searching with exclusion of common directories.\n    *   **Direct Claude CLI Execution (`execute_claude_code`, `continue_claude_code`, `resume_claude_code`)**: Spawns Claude Code commands with specified prompts and models.\n        *   **Sandbox Integration**: Uses `should_use_sandbox` and `create_sandboxed_claude_command` to decide whether to run Claude Code within a sandbox based on platform support and application settings. This is critical for security.\n        *   **Output Streaming**: Similar to agent execution, streams `stdout` and `stderr` to the frontend via `claude-output` and `claude-error` events.\n    *   **File System Browsing (`list_directory_contents`, `search_files`)**: Provides basic file explorer functionality to the frontend, with recursion depth limits for search.\n    *   **Checkpointing Integration**: Provides a set of commands that wrap the `CheckpointManager` logic:\n        *   `create_checkpoint`, `restore_checkpoint`, `list_checkpoints`, `fork_from_checkpoint`, `get_session_timeline`, `update_checkpoint_settings`, `get_checkpoint_diff`, `track_checkpoint_message`, `check_auto_checkpoint`, `cleanup_old_checkpoints`, `get_checkpoint_settings`, `clear_checkpoint_manager`, `get_checkpoint_state_stats`, `get_recently_modified_files`, `track_session_messages`.\n        *   Note the explicit loading of messages from the `jsonl` file before creating a checkpoint, ensuring the `CheckpointManager`'s internal message buffer is up-to-date.\n*   **Design Decisions/Patterns**:\n    *   **Centralized Binary Discovery**: Reuses `find_claude_binary` and `create_command_with_env` for consistency.\n    *   **Separation of CLI vs. Agent**: Provides both direct CLI interaction (where UI handles session context) and structured agent execution.\n    *   **Deep Integration with Checkpointing**: Demonstrates how backend modules can interact with the shared `CheckpointState` and `ProcessRegistryState`.\n*   **Potential Issues/Improvements**:\n    *   **Path Encoding/Decoding**: `decode_project_path` is marked as deprecated. `get_project_path_from_sessions` is preferred. This indicates a legacy issue being phased out.\n    *   **`open_new_session` in Production**: The `#[cfg(not(debug_assertions))]` block prevents direct process spawning in release builds for `open_new_session`. This is a Tauri security feature, but means this specific command won't work as expected in production. The alternative `execute_claude_code` with a prompt would be the way to start new sessions in prod.\n    *   **File System Operations Security**: While `list_directory_contents` and `search_files` are useful, they expose broad file system access. For enhanced security in some scenarios, these might need further scoping (e.g., only allowing access within a specific project directory). However, for a coding assistant, broad access is often required.\n    *   **`get_claude_settings_sync`**: The synchronous helper function is necessary for `should_use_sandbox` but typically should be avoided for file I/O in a GUI app's main thread to prevent blocking. Spawning a new thread for this short operation or restructuring could be an option for more complex sync needs.\n    *   **Checkpoint Message Loading**: The `create_checkpoint` command re-loads all messages from the JSONL file to `track_message`. This could be inefficient if the `CheckpointManager` already has most recent messages. Optimizing this to only track *new* messages or validating consistency would be an improvement.\n\n### `src-tauri/src/commands/mcp.rs`\n\n*   **Purpose**: Provides commands to interact with Claude Code's Multi-Agent Communication Protocol (MCP) functionality, specifically for managing external MCP servers.\n*   **Key Functionality**:\n    *   **`execute_claude_mcp_command`**: A helper to shell out to `claude mcp` with various subcommands.\n    *   **`mcp_add`**: Adds a new MCP server configuration. Handles `stdio` and `sse` transports, arguments, and environment variables.\n    *   **`mcp_list`**: Lists configured MCP servers by parsing the text output of `claude mcp list`. This text parsing is a bit brittle, as it relies on specific output formatting.\n    *   **`mcp_get`**: Retrieves details for a specific MCP server, also by parsing text output.\n    *   **`mcp_remove`**: Removes an MCP server configuration.\n    *   **`mcp_add_json`**: Adds a server from a JSON configuration string.\n    *   **`mcp_add_from_claude_desktop`**: Attempts to import MCP server configurations from a legacy Claude Desktop config file (macOS/Linux specific paths). This is a good migration utility.\n    *   **`mcp_serve`**: Starts Claude Code itself as an MCP server.\n    *   **`mcp_test_connection`**: Tests connectivity to a configured MCP server.\n    *   **`mcp_reset_project_choices`**: Resets user approvals for project-scoped servers.\n    *   **`mcp_get_server_status`**: Placeholder; currently returns an empty `HashMap`. This would need actual logic to query live server statuses.\n    *   **`mcp_read_project_config`, `mcp_save_project_config`**: Reads and writes `.mcp.json` files within projects for project-specific server configurations.\n*   **Design Decisions/Patterns**:\n    *   **CLI Wrapper**: Most MCP commands are direct wrappers around `claude mcp` CLI subcommands.\n    *   **Claude Binary Discovery**: Reuses the `find_claude_binary` utility.\n*   **Potential Issues/Improvements**:\n    *   **Output Parsing Brittleness**: Parsing `claude mcp list` and `claude mcp get` text output is highly sensitive to changes in the Claude Code CLI's output format. A more robust approach would be if `claude mcp` offered a JSON output format for these commands.\n    *   **`mcp_get_server_status` not implemented**: This command is critical for showing the UI the real-time status of MCP servers. It needs implementation (e.g., pinging SSE endpoints or checking process status for stdio servers).\n    *   **`mcp_add` Arguments**: The argument parsing for `mcp_add` using `cmd_args.push(\"--\");` to separate command from its arguments (`cmd_args.push(cmd);` then `cmd_args.push(arg);`) is a common pattern for CLI tools, but relies on `claude mcp add` understanding this.\n    *   **Error Handling**: Continues to use `map_err(|e| e.to_string())`.\n\n### `src-tauri/src/commands/sandbox.rs`\n\n*   **Purpose**: Provides Tauri commands for managing sandbox profiles and rules in the application's SQLite database, interacting with the `gaol` sandboxing library, and logging/retrieving sandbox violation data.\n*   **Key Functionality**:\n    *   **`SandboxViolation`**: Data structure for a recorded sandbox violation.\n    *   **`SandboxProfileExport`, `SandboxProfileWithRules`, `ImportResult`**: Data structures for exporting and importing sandbox configurations.\n    *   **CRUD for Sandbox Profiles (`list_sandbox_profiles`, `create_sandbox_profile`, `update_sandbox_profile`, `delete_sandbox_profile`, `get_sandbox_profile`)**: Standard database operations for `sandbox_profiles` table. Includes logic for managing the `is_default` flag.\n    *   **CRUD for Sandbox Rules (`list_sandbox_rules`, `create_sandbox_rule`, `update_sandbox_rule`, `delete_sandbox_rule`)**: Standard database operations for `sandbox_rules` table.\n    *   **`get_platform_capabilities`**: Exposes the platform's sandboxing support information to the frontend.\n    *   **`test_sandbox_profile`**: A crucial command for validating sandbox configurations. It loads a profile and its rules, attempts to build a `gaol::profile::Profile`, and then executes a simple `echo` command within the sandbox to verify activation. Provides detailed feedback including platform support notes.\n    *   **Sandbox Violation Management (`list_sandbox_violations`, `log_sandbox_violation`, `clear_sandbox_violations`, `get_sandbox_violation_stats`)**: Records, retrieves, and clears violations in the `sandbox_violations` table. `log_sandbox_violation` is likely called internally by `gaol`'s policy enforcement.\n    *   **Import/Export (`export_sandbox_profile`, `export_all_sandbox_profiles`, `import_sandbox_profiles`)**: Allows users to back up and share sandbox configurations. `import_sandbox_profiles` handles name conflicts by renaming imported profiles.\n*   **Design Decisions/Patterns**:\n    *   **Database-backed Configuration**: Sandbox profiles and rules are stored in SQLite, allowing for persistent, user-manageable configurations.\n    *   **`gaol` Integration**: Leverages the `gaol` crate for low-level sandboxing (via `ProfileBuilder`, `SandboxExecutor`).\n    *   **Clear Validation**: `test_sandbox_profile` provides good feedback, including warnings for platform limitations or incomplete configurations.\n*   **Potential Issues/Improvements**:\n    *   **Default Profile Deletion**: The restriction on deleting the default profile is good.\n    *   **`test_sandbox_profile` Limitations**: The `echo` test is basic. A more comprehensive test might involve attempting file access, network access, etc., and verifying policy enforcement by monitoring `gaol`'s violation reports. (This would require more sophisticated `gaol` integration or mocking).\n    *   **Error Handling**: Consistent `map_err(|e| e.to_string())`.\n    *   **Rule Conflict Validation**: The `create_sandbox_rule` has a `TODO: Add more validation logic here`. This is an important area for improvement to prevent logically conflicting or redundant rules.\n\n### `src-tauri/src/commands/usage.rs`\n\n*   **Purpose**: Provides commands to analyze and aggregate usage data from Claude Code's JSONL output files, calculating costs, token usage, and session statistics.\n*   **Key Functionality**:\n    *   **Data Structures**: Defines `UsageEntry`, `UsageStats`, `ModelUsage`, `DailyUsage`, `ProjectUsage` for representing raw and aggregated usage data.\n    *   **Pricing Constants**: Hardcodes Claude 4 pricing.\n    *   **`calculate_cost`**: Computes cost based on model and token types.\n    *   **`parse_jsonl_file`**: Reads a single JSONL file, extracts relevant fields (`timestamp`, `model`, `usage`, `costUSD`, `sessionId`, `cwd`), and calculates cost if `costUSD` is missing. It includes a deduplication mechanism using `message.id` and `request_id`.\n    *   **`get_earliest_timestamp`**: Helper to find the earliest timestamp in a JSONL file, used for sorting.\n    *   **`get_all_usage_entries`**: Recursively walks `~/.claude/projects` to find all `.jsonl` files, parses them, and collects all `UsageEntry` records. It sorts files by earliest timestamp to ensure deterministic deduplication.\n    *   **`get_usage_stats`**: Aggregates `UsageEntry` data into overall, per-model, per-day, and per-project statistics. Supports an optional `days` filter.\n    *   **`get_usage_by_date_range`**: Filters usage statistics by a specified date range.\n    *   **`get_usage_details`**: Returns raw `UsageEntry` data, with optional filters for project path and date.\n    *   **`get_session_stats`**: Aggregates usage data specifically by session, allowing filtering by date range and sorting.\n*   **Design Decisions/Patterns**:\n    *   **Offline Data Processing**: Processes existing JSONL files on disk rather than relying on real-time stream processing or a database for every token. This is efficient for historical data.\n    *   **Deduplication**: `processed_hashes` is a good way to handle potentially duplicate entries if the Claude Code output itself can repeat messages.\n    *   **Memoization/Caching**: `get_all_usage_entries` could be expensive for many projects/sessions. A caching mechanism (e.g., storing the parsed entries in memory or a separate lightweight DB) would improve performance on subsequent calls if the underlying files haven't changed.\n*   **Potential Issues/Improvements**:\n    *   **Performance for Large Data Sets**: `get_all_usage_entries` involves extensive file system traversal and string parsing (`fs::read_to_string`, `lines`, `serde_json::from_str`). For users with thousands of sessions or very large JSONL files, this could be slow. Caching or incremental updates would be beneficial.\n    *   **Hardcoded Pricing**: Pricing is hardcoded and may become outdated as Claude changes its pricing model. An external configuration or API call for pricing would be more flexible.\n    *   **JSONL Parsing Robustness**: Relies on specific fields (`message`, `usage`, `timestamp`, `sessionId`, `requestId`, `costUSD`, `cwd`) being present. Missing fields are handled with `unwrap_or(0)` or `None`, which is generally safe but might hide malformed data.\n    *   **Error Handling**: Continues to use `map_err(|e| e.to_string())`.\n\n### `src-tauri/src/process/mod.rs`\n\n*   **Purpose**: Simple module declaration file for process management.\n*   **Key Functionality**: Declares `registry` as a public module.\n\n### `src-tauri/src/process/registry.rs`\n\n*   **Purpose**: Provides a centralized, thread-safe registry to keep track of active `Child` processes spawned by the application, specifically for agent runs. This allows the application to monitor, kill, and retrieve live output from these processes.\n*   **Key Data Structures**:\n    *   `ProcessInfo`: Basic metadata about a running process (run ID, agent ID/name, PID, start time, project path, task, model).\n    *   `ProcessHandle`: Holds `ProcessInfo`, an `Arc<Mutex<Option<Child>>>` for the actual `tokio::process::Child` handle, and an `Arc<Mutex<String>>` for `live_output`.\n    *   `ProcessRegistry`: The main struct holding a `HashMap` mapping `run_id` to `ProcessHandle`.\n*   **Key Functionality**:\n    *   **`register_process`**: Adds a new process to the registry. It wraps the `Child` handle in `Arc<Mutex<Option<Child>>>` to allow for safe sharing and mutation (e.g., `kill()` can consume the `Child` handle, so `Option` is used).\n    *   **`unregister_process`**: Removes a process from the registry.\n    *   **`get_running_processes`, `get_process`**: Retrieves information about active processes.\n    *   **`kill_process`**: Attempts to terminate a child process. It requires taking the `Child` out of the `Option` inside the `Mutex` to call `kill()`.\n    *   **`is_process_running`**: Checks if a registered process is still active using `child.try_wait()`.\n    *   **`append_live_output`, `get_live_output`**: Manages a per-process buffer for live `stdout` output, allowing frontend to fetch real-time logs.\n    *   **`cleanup_finished_processes`**: Iterates through registered processes, checks if they're still running, and unregisters those that have exited.\n*   **Design Decisions/Patterns**:\n    *   **Centralized Process Management**: Crucial for a desktop application that spawns many background tasks, allowing central monitoring and cleanup.\n    *   **Concurrency (`Arc`, `Mutex`)**: Correctly uses Rust's `Arc` for shared ownership and `Mutex` for exclusive, mutable access to the `Child` handle and `live_output` buffer. The `Option<Child>` is a good pattern for handling the `Child` resource being consumed by `kill()` or `wait()`.\n*   **Potential Issues/Improvements**:\n    *   **`live_output` Memory**: The `live_output` `String` will grow indefinitely for very long-running or verbose processes, potentially consuming large amounts of RAM. A circular buffer or a size limit would be beneficial.\n    *   **Error Handling**: Consistent `map_err(|e| e.to_string())`.\n\n### `src-tauri/src/sandbox/defaults.rs`\n\n*   **Purpose**: Populates the SQLite database with a set of predefined sandbox profiles and their associated rules during initial application setup.\n*   **Key Functionality**:\n    *   **`create_default_profiles`**: Checks if any profiles exist; if not, it creates \"Standard\", \"Minimal\", and \"Development\" profiles.\n    *   **`create_standard_profile`, `create_minimal_profile`, `create_development_profile`**: Helper functions that insert profile metadata and a predefined set of `SandboxRule`s into the database.\n*   **Design Decisions/Patterns**:\n    *   **Seed Data**: Provides a starting set of configurations for the user.\n    *   **Convenience**: Simplifies initial setup by not requiring manual rule creation.\n    *   **Platform-Specific Rules**: Rules include `platform_support` JSON strings, allowing rules to be selectively applied based on the OS.\n*   **Potential Issues/Improvements**:\n    *   **No Rollback on Error**: If `create_default_profiles` fails midway, the database might be in an inconsistent state (e.g., partial profiles created). A transaction could wrap these inserts to ensure atomicity.\n    *   **Extensibility**: If new default profiles are added in future versions, there's no explicit migration path for users who already have profiles. A more robust system might check for missing default profiles by name and offer to add them.\n\n### `src-tauri/src/sandbox/executor.rs`\n\n*   **Purpose**: The core logic for interacting with the `gaol` sandboxing library. It builds the `gaol::profile::Profile` from our internal representation and handles the actual execution of commands within the sandbox environment.\n*   **Key Functionality**:\n    *   **`SandboxExecutor`**: Holds the `gaol::profile::Profile`, `project_path`, and an optional `SerializedProfile` (for inter-process communication).\n    *   **`execute_sandboxed_spawn`**: This function is somewhat tricky. `gaol`'s `sandbox.start()` spawns a child process *and* activates the sandbox. However, it *doesn't* return the `std::process::Child` handle directly, making it hard to manage its lifecycle from the parent. The code comments this limitation and *falls back* to a method where the sandbox activation happens *inside the child process*.\n    *   **`prepare_sandboxed_command`**: This is the *preferred* method. It sets environment variables (`GAOL_SANDBOX_ACTIVE`, `GAOL_PROJECT_PATH`, `GAOL_SANDBOX_RULES`) on the `tokio::process::Command` instance. The expectation is that the spawned child process (e.g., the `claude` binary) will read these environment variables and call `SandboxExecutor::activate_sandbox_in_child()` itself.\n    *   **`extract_sandbox_rules`**: Converts `gaol`'s internal `Profile` into a `SerializedProfile` for passing via environment variables. This is a workaround since `gaol` doesn't directly expose this.\n    *   **`activate_sandbox_in_child`**: This critical static method is intended to be called by the *child process itself* (e.g., the Claude Code binary, if modified to do so). It reads sandbox rules from `GAOL_SANDBOX_RULES` environment variable, deserializes them, constructs a `gaol::profile::Profile`, and then calls `ChildSandbox::activate()`.\n    *   **`should_activate_sandbox`**: Checks if `GAOL_SANDBOX_ACTIVE` environment variable is set to \"1\".\n    *   **`SerializedProfile`, `SerializedOperation`**: Custom structs for serializing `gaol` profile operations to JSON, allowing them to be passed as environment variables.\n    *   **`deserialize_profile`, `create_minimal_profile`**: Helpers for reconstructing `gaol` profiles from serialized data or creating a basic one if deserialization fails.\n*   **Design Decisions/Patterns**:\n    *   **Out-of-Process Sandboxing**: `gaol` is designed for activating sandboxes in child processes. The chosen approach (passing rules via env vars and activating in child) is a common pattern for integrating sandboxing libraries.\n    *   **Environment Variable-based Communication**: Uses environment variables for IPC of sandbox rules and flags to the child process.\n    *   **Defense in Depth**: The attempt to use `sandbox.start()` and the fallback indicate a desire for robust sandboxing, even if the primary method has limitations.\n*   **Potential Issues/Improvements**:\n    *   **\"TEMPORARILY DISABLED\" Sandbox Environment Variables**: The crucial `GAOL_*` environment variables are *commented out* in `prepare_sandboxed_command`. This means the sandbox is *not being activated* in the child process as intended. This is a severe security vulnerability. **This needs immediate attention and re-enabling.** The comment indicates it might have been for debugging, but it means the application is currently running unsandboxed by default when `execute_agent` is called.\n    *   **Claude Code Integration**: For `activate_sandbox_in_child` to work, the `claude` binary *itself* must be modified to include and call this Rust function when it starts up. Without explicit modification of `claude`, this server-side sandboxing won't take effect. This implies `claude` is either a custom build or is expected to integrate `gaol`. If `claude` is a standard Node.js application, it won't magically activate a Rust-based sandbox. This is a critical architectural dependency that needs clarification. If Claude Code is *not* instrumented with `gaol`, then this sandboxing approach will not work.\n    *   **Error Reporting from Child**: If `activate_sandbox_in_child` fails within the Claude process, it currently logs errors but doesn't necessarily communicate them back to the parent.\n    *   **Security Implications of Env Vars**: Passing sensitive or large data via environment variables can sometimes lead to issues (e.g., max env var size on some systems, exposure in process listings). The chosen approach is common, but limits should be considered.\n    *   **`extract_sandbox_rules` Accuracy**: `extract_sandbox_rules` returns a hardcoded `SerializedProfile`. This means the `serialized_profile` will NOT accurately represent the `gaol::profile::Profile` that was actually built, which defeats the purpose of serializing it. This is a bug; it should reflect the actual `profile` being used. The `build_profile_with_serialization` function addresses this correctly by returning both.\n\n### `src-tauri/src/sandbox/mod.rs`\n\n*   **Purpose**: Standard Rust module declaration file for the `sandbox` module.\n*   **Key Functionality**: Re-exports public items from its sub-modules, making them easily accessible.\n\n### `src-tauri/src/sandbox/platform.rs`\n\n*   **Purpose**: Provides information about the sandboxing capabilities of the current operating system, allowing the application to adapt its behavior or inform the user.\n*   **Key Functionality**:\n    *   **`PlatformCapabilities`**: Struct describing OS name, whether sandboxing is supported, and a list of `OperationSupport` levels.\n    *   **`OperationSupport`**: Describes a specific sandboxing operation (e.g., `file_read_all`) and its `support_level` (\"never\", \"can_be_allowed\", \"cannot_be_precisely\", \"always\").\n    *   **`get_platform_capabilities`**: Detects the OS and returns relevant capabilities and notes.\n    *   **`is_sandboxing_available`**: Simple check for common supported platforms.\n*   **Design Decisions/Patterns**:\n    *   **Platform-Specific Logic**: Encapsulates OS-specific details for sandboxing, keeping it separate from generic profile management.\n    *   **Informative**: Provides human-readable notes about the specifics of sandboxing on each OS.\n*   **Potential Issues/Improvements**:\n    *   **\"cannot_be_precisely\"**: The descriptions like \"Cannot be precisely controlled, allowed if file read is allowed\" indicate a limitation of the underlying `gaol` library's support for specific operation granularities. This is a `gaol` limitation rather than a code issue.\n    *   **Windows Support**: Explicitly states `sandboxing_supported: false` for Windows in the `is_sandboxing_available` function. This aligns with `gaol`'s current primary focus on Unix-like systems.\n\n### `src-tauri/src/sandbox/profile.rs`\n\n*   **Purpose**: Defines the data models for sandbox profiles and rules (as stored in the database) and provides the logic to translate these database records into `gaol::profile::Profile` objects, which `gaol` uses for actual sandboxing.\n*   **Key Data Structures**:\n    *   `SandboxProfile`: Represents a user-defined sandbox profile.\n    *   `SandboxRule`: Represents a single permission rule within a profile.\n    *   `ProfileBuildResult`: Combines the `gaol::profile::Profile` with its `SerializedProfile` for IPC.\n    *   `ProfileBuilder`: Helper for constructing `gaol::profile::Profile` from `SandboxRule`s. It resolves template variables like `{{PROJECT_PATH}}` and `{{HOME}}`.\n*   **Key Functionality**:\n    *   **`ProfileBuilder::new`**: Initializes with `project_path` and `home_dir` to enable template variable expansion.\n    *   **`build_agent_profile`**: Creates a profile for agent execution, *filtering rules* based on agent-specific permissions (`enable_file_read`, `enable_network`, etc.). This is excellent, as it allows agents to declare their minimum necessary permissions and the sandbox dynamically adapts.\n    *   **`build_profile`, `build_profile_with_serialization`**: Core logic to convert a `Vec<SandboxRule>` into a `gaol::profile::Profile` and a `SerializedProfile`. It iterates through rules, constructs `gaol::profile::Operation` objects, and handles `pattern_type` to build `PathPattern` and `AddressPattern`.\n    *   **Template Variable Expansion**: `{{PROJECT_PATH}}` and `{{HOME}}` are replaced with actual paths.\n    *   **Platform Support Filtering**: `is_rule_supported_on_platform` ensures that rules only apply if the current OS is in their `platform_support` list.\n    *   **Default Project Access**: Ensures that even if no explicit rule for `{{PROJECT_PATH}}` is given, it's always included if file reading is enabled for the agent.\n    *   **`load_profile`, `load_default_profile`, `load_profile_rules`**: Database access functions for retrieving profiles and their rules.\n    *   **`get_gaol_profile`**: Combines loading profile/rules from DB with building the `gaol::Profile`.\n*   **Design Decisions/Patterns**:\n    *   **Abstraction Layer**: `SandboxProfile` and `SandboxRule` provide a higher-level abstraction over `gaol`'s raw `Profile` and `Operation` types, making them easier to manage in a database.\n    *   **Runtime Profile Generation**: Profiles are generated dynamically based on stored rules and current context (project path, agent permissions).\n    *   **Separation of Concerns**: Clearly separates data storage from the `gaol` library's specific types and logic.\n*   **Potential Issues/Improvements**:\n    *   **Error Handling**: Consistent `map_err(|e| e.to_string())` and `anyhow::Context`.\n    *   **`build_operation_with_serialization` Error Handling**: `pattern_value.parse::<u16>()` using `.context(\"Invalid TCP port number\")?` is good.\n    *   **Default Behavior for Unknown Rule Types**: `_ => Ok(None)` in `build_operation_with_serialization` for unknown operation types means unsupported/unrecognized rules are silently ignored. This is a reasonable default but could be more explicit (e.g., logging a warning).\n\n### `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`\n\n*   **Purpose**: The main library file for the Tauri application. It declares the modules and sets up the Tauri builder for plugins.\n*   **Key Functionality**:\n    *   Declares `commands`, `sandbox`, `checkpoint`, `process` as modules.\n    *   `run()`: The entry point for the Tauri application. Initializes `tauri_plugin_opener` and starts the Tauri runtime.\n*   **Design Decisions/Patterns**: Standard Tauri application structure.\n\n### `src-tauri/src/main.rs`\n\n*   **Purpose**: The primary entry point for the Rust backend of the Tauri application. It initializes global application state (database, checkpoint managers, process registry), sets up Tauri plugins, and registers all exposed Tauri commands.\n*   **Key Functionality**:\n    *   **Logger Initialization**: `env_logger::init()` for logging output.\n    *   **Child Process Sandbox Activation**: Crucially, checks `sandbox::executor::should_activate_sandbox()` early. If `GAOL_SANDBOX_ACTIVE=1` is present in the environment (meaning this is a child process spawned to be sandboxed), it calls `SandboxExecutor::activate_sandbox_in_child()`. This is where the in-child sandboxing *should* be activated.\n    *   **Tauri Builder Setup**:\n        *   Registers `tauri_plugin_opener` and `tauri_plugin_dialog`.\n        *   **State Management**: `app.manage` is used to inject shared, mutable state into the Tauri application context:\n            *   `AgentDb`: SQLite connection for agents, sandbox configs, and app settings.\n            *   `CheckpointState`: Manages `CheckpointManager` instances per session. It also initializes the `claude_dir` asynchronously.\n            *   `ProcessRegistryState`: Manages active child processes.\n        *   **Invoke Handler Registration**: Lists *all* Tauri commands (`tauri::generate_handler!`) that the frontend can call. This extensive list shows the full surface area of the backend API.\n*   **Design Decisions/Patterns**:\n    *   **Dependency Injection (Tauri `State`)**: Global, shared resources are managed and injected into command functions via Tauri's `State` system.\n    *   **Centralized Command Registration**: All frontend-callable functions are registered in one place.\n    *   **Asynchronous Initialization**: `claude_dir` is set in a `tauri::async_runtime::spawn` task to avoid blocking the main thread during setup.\n*   **Potential Issues/Improvements**:\n    *   **Sandbox Activation (Critical Issue)**: As noted in `src-tauri/src/sandbox/executor.rs`, if the `GAOL_*` environment variables are commented out when preparing the command, then the `if sandbox::executor::should_activate_sandbox()` block in `main.rs` will *never* be true, meaning the sandbox activation in the child process will *never* occur. This must be verified and fixed if the intent is to have sandboxed execution.\n    *   **Error Handling in Setup**: `expect()` calls in setup block (e.g., `init_database().expect(...)`) will cause the application to crash on startup if database initialization fails. While fatal for a database, more graceful error reporting (e.g., to logs and user) might be desirable in a production app.\n\n## Overall Summary\n\nThe backend system is a robust and well-structured application using Rust and Tauri. It clearly separates concerns into modules for commands, sandboxing, checkpointing, and process management. Key strengths include:\n\n*   **Comprehensive Features**: Covers core requirements for a desktop coding assistant: project/session management, AI agent execution, sandboxing, checkpointing (version control for code), usage tracking, and multi-agent protocol support.\n*   **Strong Data Modeling**: Well-defined `serde`-compatible data structures facilitate IPC and persistence.\n*   **Concurrency Safety**: Extensive use of `Arc` and `RwLock`/`Mutex` for managing shared mutable state ensures thread safety.\n*   **Modular Design**: Clear separation of `mod.rs` files, `manager` for logic, `storage` for persistence, and `state` for global access.\n*   **Security Focus (Sandboxing)**: Integration with the `gaol` crate for sandboxing, configurable profiles, and a violation logging system. The dynamic profile generation based on agent permissions is a good practice.\n*   **Process Management**: A dedicated `ProcessRegistry` is vital for tracking and controlling long-running agent processes.\n*   **User-Configurability**: Allows users to manage agents, sandbox profiles, and Claude binary paths.\n\n**Major Area for Review/Correction: Sandboxing Implementation.** The \"TEMPORARILY DISABLED\" environment variables in `src-tauri/src/sandbox/executor.rs` are a critical concern. If this is still the case, the application is not truly sandboxing agent processes. Additionally, the dependency on the `claude` binary itself to call the `activate_sandbox_in_child` function needs to be confirmed. If `claude` is a standard external binary, this integration might not be working as intended."

      "agent": "AI Agent Orchestrator",
      "findings": "The Agentic Project Management (APM) framework, designed by CobuterMan and specialized for Large Language Model (LLM) integration (particularly Claude), demonstrates a sophisticated approach to orchestrating autonomous AI agents for complex project execution. The analyzed files, comprising `prompts`, `rules`, and `docs`, reveal a meticulously structured methodology centered on clear communication, context management, and disciplined execution.\n\n### Overall Design Principles & Observations:\n\n1.  **Orchestration via Prompts:** The core of the APM framework lies in its detailed and prescriptive Markdown prompts. These prompts serve as the operating manual for LLMs, defining their roles, responsibilities, communication protocols, and expected outputs.\n2.  **User-Centric Communication Hub:** The \"User\" acts as the central communication conduit, bridging the interactions between different AI agents and providing critical human oversight, approval, and feedback. This hybrid approach leverages LLM capabilities while maintaining human control and direction.\n3.  **Robust Context Management:** A standout feature is the explicit focus on managing LLM context limitations. The `Memory Bank` and `Handover Protocol` are fundamental solutions ensuring project continuity, knowledge preservation, and seamless transitions between agent instances, even for long-duration projects.\n4.  **Structured Artifact Generation:** The framework mandates specific Markdown formats for key project artifacts like the `Implementation Plan` and `Memory Bank logs`. This structural consistency is critical for LLMs to generate parseable, actionable, and reviewable outputs, and for other agents (or the Manager Agent itself) to consume them.\n5.  **Behavioral Guidance & Self-Correction:** Prompts often include meta-instructions (e.g., \"Crucial Note to Self,\" \"Self-Correction & Guidance\") and the `rules` files provide targeted reminders. This aims to guide the LLM's internal reasoning and ensure adherence to APM principles.\n6.  **Hierarchical Project Decomposition:** The `Implementation Plan` emphasizes breaking down projects into phases, tasks, and granular sub-tasks, with explicit agent assignments and \"guiding notes.\" This ensures that complex problems are modularized into actionable units for LLMs.\n7.  **Traceability and Auditability:** The `Memory Bank` serves as a chronological ledger, capturing all significant actions, decisions, and outputs, thereby providing a comprehensive audit trail and shared context.\n8.  **Tooling Integration Hints:** The presence of `.mdc` rule files and `start of cell`/`end of cell` markers in markdown suggest integration with specific interactive development environments (like Cursor IDE) that can interpret and apply these rules or execute code cells within the agent's context.\n\n---\n\n### File-Specific Analysis:\n\n#### `agentic-flow/prompts/00_Initial_Manager_Setup/`\n\n1.  **`01_Initiation_Prompt.md` (Manager Agent Initiation Protocol)**\n    *   **Purpose & Functionality:** This is the foundational prompt for activating the Manager Agent (MA). It defines the MA's central orchestrator role, outlines the entire APM workflow, introduces key components (Implementation Agents, Memory Bank, User, Handover Protocol), and details the MA's initial two phases of responsibility: \"Initial Project Integration & Contextual Assimilation\" and \"Strategic Planning & Implementation Plan Development.\"\n    *   **Key Patterns & Design Decisions:** Establishes the MA as the \"central orchestrator.\" Highlights the User as the primary communication bridge. The phased approach to setup (`Phase A`, `Phase B`) provides a structured onboarding for the MA. It directly references several other core APM guides, emphasizing an interconnected system. The \"Crucial Note to Self\" is a meta-instruction for the LLM.\n    *   **Potential Issues/Improvements:** While comprehensive, its length could contribute to context window pressure for the MA over time, necessitating the Handover Protocol. Clarity on how the MA \"accesses\" other guides (e.g., via RAG, User provision) is crucial.\n    *   **Relationships:** Core to the system; references `05_Handover_Protocol_Guide.md`, `01_Implementation_Plan_Guide.md`, `02_Memory_Bank_Guide.md`, `03_Task_Assignment_Prompts_Guide.md`. It sets the stage for the entire project lifecycle.\n\n2.  **`02_Codebase_Guidance.md` (APM Guided Project Discovery Protocol)**\n    *   **Purpose & Functionality:** Instructs the Manager Agent on how to conduct a structured, efficient project discovery process with the User. It guides the MA to ask targeted questions, leverage existing documentation, and synthesize information for planning.\n    *   **Key Patterns & Design Decisions:** Emphasizes \"Efficiency First\" and \"Context is Key,\" promoting adaptive inquiry over rigid questioning. The \"Strategic Discovery Sequence\" (seeking documents, understanding user vision, targeted inquiry) is a well-defined process. The \"Cognitive Synthesis & Confirmation\" step is vital for LLM alignment with user understanding.\n    *   **Potential Issues/Improvements:** Relies heavily on the User's ability to provide clear and comprehensive information. The MA needs strong reasoning to know *when* to stop inquiring and move to planning.\n    *   **Relationships:** Directly follows `01_Initiation_Prompt.md` (as Option B for project discovery). Mentions a `Cursor IDE Rule` (`@apm_discovery_synthesis_reminder`), indicating integration with an external agent orchestration environment.\n\n#### `agentic-flow/prompts/01_Manager_Agent_Core_Guides/`\n\n1.  **`01_Implementation_Plan_Guide.md` (APM Implementation Plan Formatting Guide)**\n    *   **Purpose & Functionality:** Defines the strict Markdown format and best practices for creating the `Implementation_Plan.md` file, the central blueprint for project execution.\n    *   **Key Patterns & Design Decisions:** Mandates a hierarchical structure (Phases, Tasks, Sub-tasks) with clear headings. **Crucially, it requires explicit agent assignment for every task** and the inclusion of \"Guiding Notes\" for specific action steps. This ensures that the LLM's high-level planning translates into actionable, constrained instructions for implementers. The \"Prerequisite: User Approval of Plan Structure\" ensures human oversight.\n    *   **Potential Issues/Improvements:** The detail is excellent, but ensuring the LLM consistently adheres to all nuanced formatting rules (e.g., `Guidance:` notes syntax, multi-agent task assignment) could require robust internal prompting or fine-tuning.\n    *   **Relationships:** Directly consumed by the Manager Agent for planning. Feeds into `03_Task_Assignment_Prompts_Guide.md` (which uses the task details and guiding notes) and requires the Memory Bank structure from `02_Memory_Bank_Guide.md` to be noted within itself. Also references `05_Handover_Protocol_Guide.md`.\n\n2.  **`02_Memory_Bank_Guide.md` (APM Memory Bank System Guide)**\n    *   **Purpose & Functionality:** Guides the Manager Agent in assessing project complexity to determine and set up the most suitable Memory Bank system (single `Memory_Bank.md` file vs. multi-file `Memory/` directory).\n    *   **Key Patterns & Design Decisions:** Provides clear criteria (project phasing, number/nature of tasks, granularity, duration, agent count) for the MA to make an informed decision. Defines precise setup instructions, including initial file/directory headers and strict naming conventions (e.g., `Phase_X_Title_From_Plan/`, `Task_[Phase.Task]_Short_Task_Description_Log.md`). Emphasizes validation against the `Implementation_Plan.md`.\n    *   **Potential Issues/Improvements:** The detailed naming conventions are excellent for consistency but could be a point of error if the LLM isn't precise. The justification requirement (`why` a structure is chosen) encourages reasoning from the LLM.\n    *   **Relationships:** Interacts heavily with `01_Implementation_Plan_Guide.md` (as its structure dictates Memory Bank design) and `Memory_Bank_Log_Format.md` (for individual log entry content). Referenced by `01_Initiation_Prompt.md`.\n\n3.  **`03_Task_Assignment_Prompts_Guide.md` (APM Task Assignment Prompt Crafting Guide)**\n    *   **Purpose & Functionality:** Provides instructions for the Manager Agent to craft clear, contextual, and actionable prompts for Implementation/Specialized Agents.\n    *   **Key Patterns & Design Decisions:** Defines a flexible but comprehensive prompt structure (Agent Role, Onboarding/Context, Task Assignment, Expected Output, Logging Instructions, Clarification). **Crucially, it mandates the incorporation and expansion of \"Guiding Notes\"** from the `Implementation_Plan.md` into detailed instructions for the executing agent. This ensures that the strategic choices made in the plan are followed at the implementation level.\n    *   **Potential Issues/Improvements:** The effectiveness hinges on the Manager Agent's ability to accurately translate plan details and guiding notes into unambiguous instructions, especially for complex tasks.\n    *   **Relationships:** Directly consumes information from `01_Implementation_Plan_Guide.md`. References `Imlementation_Agent_Onboarding.md` and `Memory_Bank_Log_Format.md`.\n\n4.  **`04_Review_And_Feedback_Guide.md` (APM Review and Feedback Protocol Guide)**\n    *   **Purpose & Functionality:** Outlines the Manager Agent's protocol for reviewing completed tasks by Implementation Agents and providing structured feedback to the User.\n    *   **Key Patterns & Design Decisions:** Defines a clear, multi-step review process (parse notification, retrieve context, analyze log, evaluate output, synthesize, communicate outcome). Emphasizes strategic information requests to avoid redundant questioning. Provides clear pathways for \"Task Successful\" vs. \"Issues Identified\" scenarios, with actionable next steps.\n    *   **Potential Issues/Improvements:** The MA's ability to \"assess quality (high-level)\" relies on its reasoning capabilities and the richness of the provided logs/outputs. Deep technical review might still require human intervention or a dedicated \"Reviewer Agent.\"\n    *   **Relationships:** Crucial for closing the feedback loop in the APM workflow. Consumes logs following `Memory_Bank_Log_Format.md` and refers back to the `Implementation_Plan.md` and `03_Task_Assignment_Prompts_Guide.md` for task context and re-prompting.\n\n5.  **`05_Handover_Protocol_Guide.md` (APM Handover Protocol Guide)**\n    *   **Purpose & Functionality:** Defines the procedure for ensuring seamless project continuity by transferring context between AI agent instances, primarily when an LLM approaches its context window limit.\n    *   **Key Patterns & Design Decisions:** Identifies clear trigger conditions. Defines the two core handover artifacts: `Handover_File.md` (context dump) and `Handover_Prompt.md` (new agent initialization). **A critical design choice is \"Step X: Incorporate Recent Conversational Context,\"** which aims to bridge the gap between formally logged data and the most immediate, unlogged user directives or intentions. This acknowledges the dynamic nature of LLM interactions.\n    *   **Potential Issues/Improvements:** The success of handover relies heavily on the outgoing agent's ability to accurately synthesize and summarize all relevant project state and recent interactions. The `Handover_File.md` could still become very large if not summarized effectively.\n    *   **Relationships:** Directly defines the content and purpose of `Handover_Artifact_Format.md`. Integrates `01_Initiation_Prompt.md` for the new agent's onboarding and implicitly relies on `Memory_Bank.md` for recent logs.\n\n#### `agentic-flow/prompts/02_Utility_Prompts_And_Format_Definitions/`\n\n1.  **`Handover_Artifact_Format.md` (APM Handover Artifact Formats)**\n    *   **Purpose & Functionality:** Specifies the precise Markdown formatting for the `Handover_File.md` (context dump) and the `Handover_Prompt.md` (new agent initialization prompt).\n    *   **Key Patterns & Design Decisions:** Provides highly detailed, templated Markdown structures for both artifacts, with specific sections for project status, plan status, key decisions, memory bank entries, conversational context, code snippets, obstacles, and file manifests. The use of `start of cell`/`end of cell` markers is a notable feature, indicating integration with an execution environment that supports this. Notes on variations for specialized agent handovers show extensibility.\n    *   **Potential Issues/Improvements:** The detailed structure is excellent for parsability, but the LLM must adhere perfectly. The `start of python cell`/`end of python cell` within Markdown is specific and powerful for code inclusion.\n    *   **Relationships:** The definitive format guide for `05_Handover_Protocol_Guide.md`. References `01_Initiation_Prompt.md` and `Memory_Bank_Log_Format.md`.\n\n2.  **`Imlementation_Agent_Onboarding.md` (APM Implementation/Specialized Agent Onboarding Protocol)**\n    *   **Purpose & Functionality:** A general onboarding prompt for any agent (Implementation or Specialized) joining an APM project. It introduces their role, interaction model, and the crucial importance of the Memory Bank.\n    *   **Key Patterns & Design Decisions:** Concise and direct. Emphasizes the User as the communication bridge and mandates logging to the Memory Bank. The final instruction to \"Acknowledge that you have received and understood\" is a standard LLM prompting technique for confirmation.\n    *   **Potential Issues/Improvements:** Clear and effective for its purpose.\n    *   **Relationships:** Referenced by `03_Task_Assignment_Prompts_Guide.md` and implicitly by `Handover_Artifact_Format.md` (for new agent initialization). Highlights the role of `Memory_Bank_Log_Format.md`.\n\n3.  **`Memory_Bank_Log_Format.md` (APM Memory Bank Log Format & Logging Instructions)**\n    *   **Purpose & Functionality:** Defines the mandatory Markdown format for individual entries made to the project's Memory Bank file(s) and provides detailed instructions for agents on *how* and *when* to log.\n    *   **Key Patterns & Design Decisions:** This is a critical component for maintaining project state. It mandates a structured log entry (Agent, Task Reference, Summary, Details, Output/Result, Status, Issues/Blockers, Next Steps) and provides explicit instructions on conciseness (\"Summarize, Don't Transcribe,\" \"Focus on Key Information,\" \"Code Snippets - Use Sparingly\"). The examples of \"Good Concise Log Entry\" vs. \"Overly Verbose Log Entry\" are excellent for guiding LLM behavior. **The instruction \"Crucially, you will need to inform the User... and he shall decide whether to log and report back to the Manager or not\" reinforces the User's gatekeeper role for the Memory Bank.**\n    *   **Potential Issues/Improvements:** This file is highly effective. Ensuring LLMs consistently produce concise, informative logs is a continuous challenge, but the detailed guidance helps significantly.\n    *   **Relationships:** The most frequently referenced format guide within the APM framework. Consumed by all agents that perform work and the Manager Agent for review. Referenced by `01_Initiation_Prompt.md`, `02_Memory_Bank_Guide.md`, `03_Task_Assignment_Prompts_Guide.md`, `04_Review_And_Feedback_Guide.md`, `05_Handover_Protocol_Guide.md`, `Handover_Artifact_Format.md`, and `Imlementation_Agent_Onboarding.md`.\n\n#### `agentic-flow/rules/`\n\nThese `.mdc` files are likely \"Cursor IDE Rules\" or similar, intended to inject specific, targeted reminders or constraints into the LLM's context during operations. They represent a layer of meta-guidance.\n\n1.  **`apm_discovery_synthesis_reminder.mdc`**\n    *   **Purpose & Functionality:** Reminds the Manager Agent to synthesize gathered information after discovery and prepare to transition to the planning phase.\n    *   **Key Patterns & Design Decisions:** Short, actionable checklist. `alwaysApply: false` suggests it's triggered explicitly by the environment or agent's internal logic when specific conditions (e.g., extensive new input) are met.\n    *   **Potential Issues/Improvements:** Effective as a targeted nudge.\n\n2.  **`apm_impl_plan_critical_elements_reminder.mdc`**\n    *   **Purpose & Functionality:** Reminds the Manager Agent to ensure explicit agent assignments and \"Guiding Notes\" are included in the Implementation Plan.\n    *   **Key Patterns & Design Decisions:** Directly reinforces two critical design choices from `01_Implementation_Plan_Guide.md`.\n\n3.  **`apm_memory_naming_validation_reminder.mdc`**\n    *   **Purpose & Functionality:** Reminds agents to validate Memory Bank file/directory names against the `Implementation_Plan.md` before creation.\n    *   **Key Patterns & Design Decisions:** Crucial for maintaining the integrity and traceability of the Memory Bank by preventing naming inconsistencies.\n\n4.  **`apm_memory_system_format_source.mdc`**\n    *   **Purpose & Functionality:** Provides a quick reference (source) for the definitive guide on setting up the Memory Bank *system*.\n    *   **Key Patterns & Design Decisions:** `ruleType: Agent Requested` suggests this rule is injected when the agent explicitly asks for guidance on this topic.\n\n5.  **`apm_plan_format_source.mdc`**\n    *   **Purpose & Functionality:** Provides a quick reference (source) for the definitive guide on formatting the `Implementation_Plan.md`.\n    *   **Key Patterns & Design Decisions:** Similar to `apm_memory_system_format_source.mdc`.\n\n6.  **`apm_task_prompt_plan_guidance_incorporation_reminder.mdc`**\n    *   **Purpose & Functionality:** Reminds the Manager Agent to explicitly incorporate and expand upon \"Guiding Notes\" from the Implementation Plan into task assignment prompts.\n    *   **Key Patterns & Design Decisions:** Reinforces a critical step in ensuring LLM-generated solutions align with design choices.\n\n#### `agentic-flow/docs/`\n\nThese files provide human-readable documentation, primarily for users adopting the APM framework.\n\n1.  **`01_Workflow_Overview.md` (APM Workflow Overview)**\n    *   **Purpose & Functionality:** Provides a visual overview of the APM framework's key processes and interactions using Mermaid diagrams.\n    *   **Key Patterns & Design Decisions:** Excellent use of Mermaid for visual clarity, illustrating the \"Core APM Cycle,\" \"Handover Protocol Flow,\" and \"Memory Bank Concept.\" The use of `classDef` in Mermaid to color-code different agent types visually reinforces roles.\n    *   **Potential Issues/Improvements:** Very effective for quick conceptual understanding.\n\n2.  **`03_Core_Concepts.md` (APM Glossary of Core Concepts & Terms)**\n    *   **Purpose & Functionality:** Provides concise definitions for key APM terms, acting as a glossary and a central index to other detailed documentation.\n    *   **Key Patterns & Design Decisions:** Standard glossary format with bold terms and brief descriptions. **Crucially, each term links directly to the relevant prompt guide or detailed documentation, making it a highly effective navigation tool.**\n    *   **Potential Issues/Improvements:** Highly valuable for users and potentially useful for LLMs if they can reliably access and interpret such a cross-referencing document.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe analyzed files demonstrate a highly sophisticated and well-thought-out agentic workflow design. The APM framework addresses common challenges in LLM-driven development, such as context window limitations, consistent output generation, and multi-agent coordination. The emphasis on structured communication, explicit directives, and disciplined logging (particularly through the `Memory Bank` and `Handover Protocol`) is commendable. The layered approach, with detailed prompts for agent behavior, precise format definitions for artifacts, and targeted rules for meta-guidance, creates a robust system for orchestrating Claude and other LLMs in complex project environments. The tight coupling between planning (`Implementation_Plan.md`), execution (`Task Assignment Prompts`), and accountability (`Memory Bank` and `Review Protocol`) forms a powerful iterative loop for project progression."
