# APM Task Assignment: UI Component Updates

## 1. Agent Role & APM Context

You are activated as an Implementation Agent (Agent_Frontend) within the Agentic Project Management (APM) framework for the Claudia project enhancement. Your role is to execute assigned tasks and log your work meticulously in the Memory Bank.

## 2. Context from Prior Work

Phases 1 and 2 have established the complete backend infrastructure for multi-engine support:
- Agent struct with engine field
- Database schema with engine support
- OpenRouter API integration
- Command builders for Aider and OpenCodex

This foundation enables the frontend enhancements you'll be implementing.

## 3. Task Assignment

**Reference:** This assignment corresponds to Task 3.1 - Agent_Frontend: UI Component Updates in Phase 3 of the Implementation Plan.

**Objective:** Enhance the frontend to support multiple agent engines.

**Detailed Action Steps:**

1. Engine Selector Implementation
   - Navigate to `src/components/CreateAgent.tsx`
   - Add engine selection dropdown component
   - Integrate with `src/components/ui/select.tsx`
   - Implement model fetching via `src/lib/api.ts`
   - Update form validation logic
   - Critical: Follow existing UI component patterns for consistency

2. Model Information Display
   - Update model dropdown to show provider information
   - Add tooltips using `src/components/ui/tooltip.tsx`
   - Implement loading states for API calls
   - Add error handling for unavailable models
   - Critical: Maintain consistent UI/UX patterns

## 4. Expected Output & Deliverables

Successful completion requires:
1. Enhanced CreateAgent component with:
   - Working engine selection dropdown
   - Model selection based on chosen engine
   - Provider information display
   - Loading states and error handling

2. API Integration:
   - Proper model fetching implementation
   - Error handling for API failures
   - Loading state management

3. User Experience:
   - Consistent styling with existing components
   - Clear feedback for user actions
   - Proper form validation
   - Informative error messages

## 5. Memory Bank Logging Instructions

Upon completion of this task, you must log your work in the Memory Bank file located at:
`Memory/Phase_3_Frontend_Enhancement/Task_3.1_UI_Component_Updates_Log.md`

Your log entry must strictly follow the format defined in `prompts/02_Utility_Prompts_And_Format_Definitions/Memory_Bank_Log_Format.md` and include:
- Clear reference to Task 3.1
- Details of UI component implementations
- API integration approach
- Any challenges encountered and their resolutions
- Confirmation of successful testing

## 6. Dependencies and Prerequisites

Ensure that:
1. Phase 2 backend infrastructure is complete
2. API endpoints for model fetching are available
3. You have access to:
   - UI component library
   - API client utilities
   - Existing component patterns

## 7. Technical Requirements

1. Component Implementation:
   - Use existing UI component library
   - Follow React best practices
   - Maintain type safety with TypeScript
   
2. API Integration:
   - Handle loading states
   - Implement error boundaries
   - Cache API responses when appropriate
   
3. User Experience:
   - Provide clear feedback
   - Handle edge cases gracefully
   - Maintain responsive design

## 8. Clarification Instructions

If any part of this task is unclear, particularly regarding:
- UI component specifications
- API integration requirements
- Error handling expectations

Please ask for clarification before proceeding with implementation.
