# APM Task Assignment: Execution Logic Refactor

## 1. Agent Role & APM Context

You are activated as an Implementation Agent (Agent_Backend) within the Agentic Project Management (APM) framework for the Claudia project enhancement. Your role is to execute assigned tasks and log your work meticulously in the Memory Bank.

## 2. Context from Prior Work

This task builds upon Task 1.1 (Agent Struct Enhancement) which added the engine field to the Agent struct. With that foundation in place, we now need to modify the execution system to support different engine types.

## 3. Task Assignment

**Reference:** This assignment corresponds to Task 1.2 - Agent_Backend: Execution Logic Refactor in Phase 1 of the Implementation Plan.

**Objective:** Modify the agent execution system to support different engine types.

**Detailed Action Steps:**

1. Execution Dispatcher Creation
   - Navigate to `src-tauri/src/commands/agents.rs`
   - Modify the `execute_agent` command to include engine type inspection
   - Implement a dispatch mechanism that routes execution to engine-specific functions
   - Add comprehensive error handling for unsupported engines
   - Critical: Ensure proper error propagation to frontend by implementing consistent error types

2. Engine-Specific Function Implementation
   - Create `execute_claude_agent` function containing the existing Claude-specific logic
   - Create `execute_aider_agent` function as a placeholder for future Aider integration
   - Create `execute_opencodex_agent` function as a placeholder for future OpenCodex integration
   - Add necessary type definitions and interfaces for all engine functions
   - Critical: Maintain consistent error handling patterns across all engine functions

## 4. Expected Output & Deliverables

Successful completion requires:
1. Modified `agents.rs` file with:
   - Updated `execute_agent` command with engine type support
   - Three engine-specific execution functions
   - Proper error handling and type definitions
2. All changes must compile without errors
3. The Claude engine execution path must remain fully functional

## 5. Memory Bank Logging Instructions

Upon completion of this task, you must log your work in the Memory Bank file located at:
`Memory/Phase_1_Agent_Engine_Infrastructure/Task_1.2_Execution_Logic_Refactor_Log.md`

Your log entry must strictly follow the format defined in `prompts/02_Utility_Prompts_And_Format_Definitions/Memory_Bank_Log_Format.md` and include:
- Clear reference to Task 1.2
- Detailed description of modifications made to the execution logic
- Relevant code snippets showing key changes
- Any challenges encountered and their resolutions
- Confirmation of successful testing, especially for the Claude engine path

## 6. Clarification Instructions

If any part of this task is unclear, particularly regarding:
- The dispatch mechanism implementation
- Error handling requirements
- Integration with existing Claude functionality

Please ask for clarification before proceeding with implementation.

## 7. Dependencies and Prerequisites

Ensure that:
1. Task 1.1 (Agent Struct Enhancement) is fully completed and verified
2. The Agent struct has the engine field properly implemented
3. You have access to the existing Claude execution logic for reference

Proceed only if all prerequisites are met.
