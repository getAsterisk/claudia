  "description": "Use this agent when you need to analyze code for quality, structure, patterns, potential issues, or to understand how code works. This includes reviewing code architecture, identifying bugs, suggesting improvements, analyzing complexity, checking for best practices, or explaining code functionality. <example>Context: The user is creating a code analysis agent that should be called to review and analyze code quality and structure.\\nuser: \"I've just implemented a new authentication system\"\\nassistant: \"I'll use the code-analyzer agent to review your authentication implementation\"\\n<commentary>Since the user has implemented new code and wants analysis, use the Task tool to launch the code-analyzer agent to review the code quality, security, and structure.</commentary></example><example>Context: User wants to understand how a complex function works.\\nuser: \"Can you help me understand what this sorting algorithm does?\"\\nassistant: \"Let me use the code-analyzer agent to analyze and explain this sorting algorithm\"\\n<commentary>The user needs help understanding code functionality, so use the code-analyzer agent to analyze and explain the algorithm.</commentary></example>",
