# Chapter 3: Frontend UI Components

Welcome back to the `claudia` tutorial! In [Chapter 1: Session/Project Management](01_session_project_management_.md), we explored how `claudia` keeps track of your conversations. In [Chapter 2: Agents](02_agents_.md), we learned about creating and managing specialized configurations for Claude Code tasks.

Now, let's shift our focus to what you actually *see* and *interact with* when you use `claudia`: its graphical interface. This interface is built using **Frontend UI Components**.

## What are Frontend UI Components?

Imagine building something complex, like a house. You don't start by crafting every tiny screw and nail from raw metal. Instead, you use pre-made bricks, windows, doors, and roof tiles. These are like reusable building blocks.

Frontend UI Components in `claudia` are exactly like these building blocks, but for the visual parts of the application. They are self-contained pieces of the user interface, like:

*   A **Button** you click.
*   A **Card** that displays information (like a project or an agent).
*   An **Input** field where you type text.
*   A **List** that shows multiple items.
*   A **Dialog** box that pops up.

`claudia` uses a popular web development framework called **React** to build these components. They are written using **TypeScript** (which adds type safety) and styled using **Tailwind CSS** (a way to add styles quickly using special class names).

The key idea is reusability. Instead of designing a button from scratch every time it's needed, you create a `Button` component once and use it everywhere. This makes the UI consistent and development faster.

## Building Views by Combining Components

Just like you combine bricks and windows to build a wall, `claudia` combines different UI components to create full views (pages) of the application.

For example, the list of projects you saw in Chapter 1 is a view. This view isn't one giant piece of code; it's made by combining:

*   `Button` components (like the "Back to Home" button).
*   `Card` components, each displaying information about a single project.
*   A `ProjectList` component which *contains* all the individual project `Card`s and handles looping through the list of projects.
*   Layout components (like `div`s with Tailwind classes) to arrange everything.

Let's look at a simplified structure of the `App.tsx` file, which acts like the main blueprint for `claudia`'s views. It decides *which* major component (view) to show based on the current state (`view` variable):

```typescript
// src/App.tsx (Simplified)
import { useState } from "react";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"; // Import a UI component
import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card";     // Import another UI component
import { ProjectList } from "@/components/ProjectList"; // Import a view component
import { CCAgents } from "@/components/CCAgents";   // Import another view component
// ... other imports ...

type View = "welcome" | "projects" | "agents" | "settings" | "claude-code-session";

function App() {
  const [view, setView] = useState<View>("welcome"); // State variable to control current view
  // ... other state variables ...

  const renderContent = () => {
    switch (view) {
      case "welcome":
        // Show the welcome view, using Card and Button components
        return (
          <div className="..."> {/* Layout */}
            <Card onClick={() => setView("agents")}> {/* Uses Card */}
              <div className="...">
                {/* Icon component */}
                <h2>CC Agents</h2>
              </div>
            </Card>
            <Card onClick={() => setView("projects")}> {/* Uses Card */}
              <div className="...">
                 {/* Icon component */}
                 <h2>CC Projects</h2>
              </div>
            </Card>
          </div>
        );

      case "agents":
        // Show the Agents view, which is handled by the CCAgents component
        return <CCAgents onBack={() => setView("welcome")} />; // Uses CCAgents component

      case "projects":
        // Show the Projects/Sessions view
        return (
          <div className="..."> {/* Layout */}
             <Button onClick={() => setView("welcome")}>‚Üê Back</Button> {/* Uses Button */}
             {/* ... displays either ProjectList or SessionList based on selectedProject state ... */}
          </div>
        );

      // ... other cases for settings, session view, etc. ...

      default:
        return null;
    }
  };

  return (
    <div className="h-screen bg-background flex flex-col">
      {/* Topbar component */}
      {/* Main content area */}
      <div className="flex-1 overflow-y-auto">
        {renderContent()} {/* Renders the selected view */}
      </div>
      {/* ... other global components like dialogs ... */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

As you can see, `App.tsx` doesn't contain the detailed code for *every* button or card. Instead, it imports and uses components like `Button`, `Card`, `CCAgents`, and `ProjectList`. The `renderContent` function simply decides which larger component to display based on the `view` state.

## How Components Work Together

Components communicate with each other primarily through **props** (short for properties) and **callbacks** (functions passed as props).

*   **Props:** Data is passed *down* from parent components to child components using props. For example, the `App` component might pass the list of `projects` to the `ProjectList` component. The `ProjectList` component then passes individual `project` objects down to the `Card` components it renders.
*   **Callbacks:** When something happens inside a child component (like a button click), it needs to tell its parent. It does this by calling a function that was passed down as a prop (a callback). For example, when a `Card` in the `ProjectList` is clicked, it calls the `onProjectClick` function that was given to it by `ProjectList`. `ProjectList` received this function from `App`.

Let's revisit the `ProjectList` component from Chapter 1:

```typescript
// src/components/ProjectList.tsx (Simplified)
// ... imports ...
import { Card, CardContent } from "@/components/ui/card"; // Uses Card component
import type { Project } from "@/lib/api";

interface ProjectListProps {
  projects: Project[]; // Prop: receives array of project data
  onProjectClick: (project: Project) => void; // Prop: receives a function (callback)
}

export const ProjectList: React.FC<ProjectListProps> = ({ projects, onProjectClick }) => {
  return (
    <div className="space-y-4">
      {/* Loops through the projects array received via props */}
      {projects.map((project) => (
        // Renders a Card component for each project
        <Card key={project.id} onClick={() => onProjectClick(project)}> {/* Calls the onProjectClick callback when clicked */}
          <CardContent className="p-3"> {/* Uses CardContent sub-component */}
            <div>
              <p>{project.path}</p> {/* Displays data received from the project prop */}
              <p>{project.sessions.length} sessions</p> {/* Displays data from the project prop */}
            </div>
          </CardContent>
        </Card>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};
```

This component clearly shows:
1.  It receives data (`projects` array) and a function (`onProjectClick`) as props.
2.  It loops through the `projects` array.
3.  For each item, it renders a `Card` component (another UI component).
4.  It passes data (`project.path`, `project.sessions.length`) into the `CardContent` to be displayed.
5.  It attaches an `onClick` handler to the `Card` that calls the `onProjectClick` callback function, passing the relevant `project` data back up to the parent component (`App` in this case).

Similarly, the `CCAgents` component from Chapter 2 receives data and callbacks:

```typescript
// src/components/CCAgents.tsx (Simplified)
// ... imports ...
import { Card, CardContent, CardFooter } from "@/components/ui/card"; // Uses Card components
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"; // Uses Button component
// ... types and state ...

export const CCAgents: React.FC<CCAgentsProps> = ({ onBack, className }) => {
  // ... state for agents data ...

  // ... useEffect to load agents (calls backend, covered in Chapter 2) ...

  // Callback functions for actions
  const handleExecuteAgent = (agent: Agent) => {
    // ... navigate to execution view ...
  };
  const handleEditAgent = (agent: Agent) => {
     // ... navigate to edit view ...
  };
  const handleDeleteAgent = (agentId: number) => {
     // ... call backend API to delete ...
  };

  return (
    <div className="flex-1 overflow-hidden">
      {/* ... Back button using Button component calling onBack prop ... */}
      
      {/* Agents Grid */}
      <div className="grid grid-cols-1 ... gap-4">
        {/* Loop through agents state */}
        {agents.map((agent) => (
          <Card key={agent.id}> {/* Uses Card */}
            <CardContent className="..."> {/* Uses CardContent */}
              {/* ... display agent icon, name (data from agent state) ... */}
            </CardContent>
            <CardFooter className="..."> {/* Uses CardFooter */}
              {/* Buttons using Button component, calling local callbacks */}
              <Button size="sm" onClick={() => handleExecuteAgent(agent)}>Execute</Button>
              <Button size="sm" onClick={() => handleEditAgent(agent)}>Edit</Button>
              <Button size="sm" onClick={() => handleDeleteAgent(agent.id!)}>Delete</Button>
            </CardFooter>
          </Card>
        ))}
      </div>
      {/* ... pagination ... */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

This component shows how UI components (`Card`, `Button`) are used within a larger view component (`CCAgents`). `CCAgents` manages its own state (the list of `agents`) and defines callback functions (`handleExecuteAgent`, `handleEditAgent`, `handleDeleteAgent`) which are triggered by user interaction with the child `Button` components. It also receives an `onBack` prop from its parent (`App`) to navigate back.

## Common UI Components in `claudia`

`claudia` uses a set of pre-built, simple UI components provided by a library often referred to as "shadcn/ui" (though integrated directly into the project). You saw some examples in the code:

*   **`Button`**: Used for clickable actions (`components/ui/button.tsx`).
*   **`Card`**: Used to group related information with a border and shadow (`components/ui/card.tsx`). It often has `CardHeader`, `CardContent`, and `CardFooter` sub-components for structure.
*   **`Input`**: Used for single-line text entry fields (similar to standard HTML `<input>`, used in `CreateAgent`, `AgentExecution`).
*   **`Textarea`**: Used for multi-line text entry, like for the system prompt (`components/ui/textarea.tsx`, used in `CreateAgent`).
*   **`Switch`**: Used for toggling options on/off, like permissions in the sandbox settings (`components/ui/switch.tsx`, used in `AgentSandboxSettings`).
*   **`Label`**: Used to associate text labels with form elements (`components/ui/label.tsx`).
*   **`Popover`**: Used to display floating content when a trigger is clicked (`components/ui/popover.tsx`).
*   **`Toast`**: Used for temporary notification messages (`components/ui/toast.tsx`).

You can find these components and others in the `src/components/ui/` directory. Each file defines a single, reusable UI component using React's functional component pattern, TypeScript for typing props, and Tailwind CSS classes for styling.

For example, the `Button` component (`components/ui/button.tsx`) defines different visual `variant`s (default, destructive, outline, secondary, ghost, link) and `size`s (default, sm, lg, icon) using `class-variance-authority` and then applies the corresponding Tailwind classes (`cn` utility combines class names). When you use `<Button variant="outline" size="sm">`, you're simply telling the `Button` component which pre-defined styles to apply.

```typescript
// src/components/ui/button.tsx (Simplified)
// ... imports ...
import { cva, type VariantProps } from "class-variance-authority"; // Helps manage style variants
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"; // Utility to combine Tailwind classes

const buttonVariants = cva(
  "inline-flex items-center ... transition-colors ...", // Base styles
  {
    variants: { // Define different style options
      variant: {
        default: "bg-primary ...",
        destructive: "bg-destructive ...",
        outline: "border border-input ...",
        // ... other variants
      },
      size: { // Define different size options
        default: "h-9 px-4 py-2",
        sm: "h-8 rounded-md px-3 text-xs",
        // ... other sizes
      },
    },
    defaultVariants: { // Default options if none are specified
      variant: "default",
      size: "default",
    },
  }
);

// Define the props the Button component accepts
export interface ButtonProps
  extends React.ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement>, // Inherit standard button props
    VariantProps<typeof buttonVariants> { // Add variant/size props
  asChild?: boolean; // Optional prop for advanced use
}

// The actual React component
const Button = React.forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, ButtonProps>(
  ({ className, variant, size, ...props }, ref) => { // Destructure props
    return (
      <button
        // Combine base classes, variant classes, size classes, and any custom className
        className={cn(buttonVariants({ variant, size, className }))} 
        ref={ref} // Forward the ref if needed
        {...props} // Pass any other standard button props (like onClick, disabled)
      />
    );
  }
);
Button.displayName = "Button";

export { Button, buttonVariants }; // Export for use elsewhere
```

This shows how a basic UI component like `Button` is created. It takes props (`variant`, `size`, `className`, plus standard HTML button attributes like `onClick`), uses logic (`cn`, `cva`) to determine the final CSS classes, and renders a simple HTML `<button>` element. When other parts of the app need a button, they just import and use this component, e.g., `<Button onClick={handleSave} variant="primary">Save</Button>`.

## How it Works: Under the Hood (Frontend)

The core idea behind these UI components in React is quite simple:

1.  **They are functions or classes:** A component is essentially a JavaScript/TypeScript function (or class) that receives data as `props`.
2.  **They return UI:** This function returns a description of what the UI should look like (React elements, often resembling HTML).
3.  **React renders the UI:** React takes this description and efficiently updates the actual web page (the Document Object Model or DOM) to match.
4.  **State for interactivity:** Some components manage their own internal data called `state` (e.g., an input component's text value, whether a dialog is open). When state changes, the component re-renders.
5.  **Event Handlers:** Components respond to user interactions (like clicks, typing) by calling functions defined within them or received via props (callbacks).

The process looks like this:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[App.tsx] --> B(Passes props like projects, callbacks like handleProjectClick)
    B --> C{ProjectList Component}
    C --> D(Iterates through projects, passes individual project + onProjectClick to Cards)
    D --> E{Card Component (for a single project)}
    E --> F(Receives project data + onProjectClick)
    F -- Displays Data --> G[UI on screen (a Card)]
    G -- User Clicks Card --> H(onClick handler in Card)
    H --> I(Calls the onProjectClick callback received via props)
    I --> J(Returns the clicked project data)
    J --> C(ProjectList receives data)
    C --> K(Calls the onProjectClick callback received via props)
    K --> A(App.tsx receives clicked project data)
    A -- Updates state (e.g., setSelectedProject) --> A
    A -- Re-renders with new view --> L[New UI on screen (e.g., SessionList)]
```

This diagram shows the flow of data (props) and events (callbacks) that allows components to work together to create a dynamic interface. `App.tsx` is at the top, managing the main state (`view`, `selectedProject`). It passes data and functions down to its children (`ProjectList`). `ProjectList` loops and renders more children (`Card`). When a `Card` receives a user action, it calls a function passed down (`onProjectClick`), sending relevant data back up the chain, which triggers state changes in the parent (`App`), leading to a re-render and a different view being displayed.

## Conclusion

In this chapter, we explored Frontend UI Components, the reusable building blocks that form the visual interface of `claudia`. We learned that these components, built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, are combined like Lego bricks to create complex views like project lists, agent managers, and the main session interface.

We saw how components receive data through `props` and communicate back to their parents using `callbacks`. This system allows the UI to be modular, consistent, and maintainable. Understanding these components is key to seeing how `claudia` presents information and interacts with the user.

In the next chapter, we'll bridge the gap between the frontend UI components and the backend Rust logic by learning about [Tauri Commands](04_tauri_commands_.md). These commands are the communication layer that allows the components to ask the backend for data (like listing projects) or request actions (like executing an agent).
